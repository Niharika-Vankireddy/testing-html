<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
It describes the structure of a webpage and consists of series of elements.
It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, 
and blockquotes for webpages and applications.
It is used to create pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web. 
Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements.
